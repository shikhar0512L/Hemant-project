        <h1>Should You Upgrade To Windows 11 Just Yet? + Installation of Windows 11</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Hello folks, recently Microsoft rolled out its new Windows 11 on 5 October.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Despite being the latest version of Windows, I don't think you should upgrade to Windows 11 right now.
            Windows 11 has been optimized for good productivity and also packs with a Good UI design, but it is too
            early to migrate. I mean in probably 3-4 months I might upgrade, but not now. Why? Because I personally
            think there's not much to explore in windows 11 right now. The most hyped feature, the support for android
            apps in windows, for which I was excited about the most, got delayed, and also, there are reports coming
            that the final release has some performance issues. I heard some news where a user said <strong>“A Dell XPS
                13 just felt slower, despite its 10th-generation Intel processor and 8 gigabytes of RAM. Even when I
                closed Slack, which was eating RAM like a hungry hippo, the computer still wasn't as peppy as it was on
                Windows 10. If your older computer is still running smoothly on Windows 10, you might think twice before
                upgrading.” </strong> </p>
        <hr>
        <p>If you still dare to upgrade to Windows 11, then here's the official method to do so.</p>
        <hr>
        <p> <strong>Steps to install Windows 11 </strong> (without losing any data) </p>
        <hr>
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows11">Navigate here</a>
        <hr>
        <p>Now click on download installation assistant.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="https://api.codewithharry.com/media/blogFiles/windows-11-update-installation/image6.png" alt="img1">
        <hr>
        <p>Now open the assistant and click on agree to start the installation.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="https://api.codewithharry.com/media/blogFiles/windows-11-update-installation/image2.png" alt="img2">
        <hr>
        <p> <strong> NOTE: </strong> YOU MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET SO THE INSTALLER CAN DOWNLOAD THE FILES</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is how it will look while downloading</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="https://api.codewithharry.com/media/blogFiles/windows-11-update-installation/image1.png" alt="img3">
        <hr>
        <p> It will take a while, remember if you are on Laptop, make sure to plug in the charger.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Once the files are downloaded and installed it will look like this.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="https://api.codewithharry.com/media/blogFiles/windows-11-update-installation/image3.png" alt="img4">
        <hr>
        <p>Now your pc will look something like this which means we are almost there</p>
        <hr>

        <hr>
        <p>And once it is done you will be greeted with Windows 11 Lock screen</p>
        <hr>
        <p>That's all for this tutorial. Hope you will successfully upgrade to Windows 11.</p>

        <!-- NEW BLOG -->
        <h1>How to get free https on your site using Let's Encrypt SSL on Ubuntu 20.04</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Have you ever seen that green padlock at the top in the URL bar which reads "Connection is secure"? In this
            post, we will discuss how to enable HTTPS for your website hosted on ubuntu 20.04. We will use let's encrypt
            for this purpose which is a non-profit certificate authority used to get SSL certificates for your website.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Not only that we can use certbot to automatically renew these certificates which makes it a one-time task for
            a single domain.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We will assume that you already have a domain pointed to the IP address of your VPS. Follow the steps below:
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 1 - Install lets encrypt</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Execute the following commands to install let's encrypt on ubuntu:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 2 - Allow HTTPS through the firewall and configure apache2 virtual hosts</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>If you are using apache, enter the following commands to allow apache2 over the firewall:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 3 - Obtain an SSL certificate</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Run the following command to obtain an SSL certificate</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo certbot --apache</code>
        <hr>
        <p>This command shows you some prompts and finally installs an SSL certificate on the domain of your choice.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 4 - Test the auto-renewal process</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Certbot, by itself, takes care of the auto-renewal process of your SSL certificate. You can test the
            auto-renewal of your SSL certificate by firing the following commands:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo systemctl status certbot.timer</code>
        <hr>
        <p>You can even dry run the auto-renewal by using the below command:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo certbot renew --dry-run</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Hope this guide was helpful for you to install an SSL certificate on your server. Happy coding!</p>

        <h1>How to deploy flask app on Ubuntu VPS using Nginx and gunicorn</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In this post, we will see how to deploy flask applications using gunicorn WSGI server and nginx as a reverse
            proxy and static files server.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Follow the steps below:</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 1 - Install required packages</h1>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo apt update</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Now let's install python3, python3-pip, and Nginx using the commands below:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev nginx</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 2 - Creating a directory (for our flask app) and virtual environment</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Let's install virtualenv</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo pip3 install virtualenv</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Lets now create a directory to host our flask application</p>
        <hr>
        <code>mkdir myFlaskApp && cd myFlaskApp</code>
        <hr>
        <p>run the following command to create a virtual environment named env</p>
        <hr>
        <code>virtualenv env</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Finally activate the virtual environment</p>
        <hr>
        <code>source env/bin/activate</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Lets now install flask and gunicorn using pip</p>
        <hr>
        <code>pip3 install flask gunicorn</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 3 - Creating a sample project and wsgi entry point</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Let us now create a sample project by entering the command below:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>vim app.py</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Paste the contents below to app.py file</p>
        <hr>
        <code>from flask import Flask
             <br>
            app = Flask(__name__)
            <br>
            @app.route('/')
            <br>
            def hello_world():
            <br>
                return "Hello World!"
                <br>
            if __name__ == '__main__':
            <br>
                app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0')
                <br>
            </code>
        <hr>
        <p>Next, we'll create a file that will serve as the entry point for our application. This will tell our Gunicorn
            server how to interact with the application.</p>
        <hr>
        <code>vim wsgi.py</code>
        <hr>
        <p> copy the contents below to wsgi.py </p>
        <hr>
        <code>from app import app
               <br>
            if __name__ == "__main__":
            <br>
                app.run()</code>
        <hr>
        <p>We can test gunicorn's ability to serve our project by running the command below:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Folder structure so far:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>
            myFlaskApp
            <br>
  |____ app.py
  <br>
  |____ wsgi.py
  <br>
  |____ env
  <br>
        </code>
        <hr>
        <p>Lets deactivate our virtual environment now:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>deactivate</code>
        <h1>Step 4 - Creating a systemd service</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Lets now create a systemd service using the following commands:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>vim /etc/systemd/system/app.service</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Now paste the contents below to this file:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>
            [Unit]
            <br>

<br>
User=shikhar
<br>
# give group ownership to the www-data group so that Nginx can communicate easily with the Gunicorn processes.

<br>
# We'll then map out the working directory and set the PATH environmental variable so that the init system knows where our the 
<br>executables for the process are located (within our virtual environment).
<br>
WorkingDirectory=/home/shikhar/myFlaskApp/
<br>
Environment="PATH=/home/shikhar/myFlaskApp/env/bin"
<br>
# We'll then specify the commanded to start the service
<br>
ExecStart=/home/shikhar/myFlaskApp/env/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:app.sock -m 007 wsgi:app
<br>
# This will tell systemd what to link this service to if we enable it to start at boot. We want this service to start when the regular 
<br>multi-user system is up and running:
[Install]
<br>
WantedBy=multi-user.target
<br>
        </code>
        <hr>
        <p>Activate this service by typing:</p>

        <h1>How to install PhpMyAdmin on Ubuntu running Nginx (LEMP stack)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In this post, we will see how to install phpMyAdmin on servers running Nginx. Follow the steps below:</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 1 - Installing phpMyAdmin</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Enter the following command to install PHPMyAdmin</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 2 - Configuring MySQL to use a password</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Now we will configure password login to MySQL for logging into PHPMyAdmin</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Open MySQL console</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo mysql</code>
        <hr>
        <p>and execute the following query to create a new user to be used for PHPMyAdmin. </p>
        <hr>
        <code>CREATE USER 'shikhar'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'MyStrongPassword1234$';
            </code>
        <hr>
        <p>This creates a new MySQL user named shikhar with the password - 'MyStrongPassword1234$'</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Let's provide this user all the privileges so that we can use it to access the PHPMyAdmin console. Execute
            the query below</p>
        <hr>
        <code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'shikhar'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
            </code>
        <hr>
        <p>Let's exit the MySQL console now</p>
        <hr>
        <code>exit</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 3 - Create a symlink
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>You'll now need to create a symbolic link from the PHPMyAdmin files to Nginx's document root directory. This
            will tell Nginx where PhpMyAdmin files are and how to serve them!</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/phpmyadmin</code>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 4 - Check the installation</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Restart Nginx using the command below:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>sudo service nginx restart</code>
        <hr>
        <p>Now go to the http://your-server-ip/phpmyadmin from your browser and login using the username and password
            you used in step 2.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You should be able to see the PHPMyAdmin interface.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You should now have phpmyadmin configured on your server. You can use this interface to easily create, manage
            and update your databases. Happy coding!</p>

        <h1>Transferring Files, Passwordless login & Managing multiple servers</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In this post, I will show you how to avoid entering passwords multiple times while managing your servers.
            Also, I will tell you few tricks I use to manage multiple servers efficiently. Let's start with uploading
            files to the server</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Uploading files to your server</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>In order to upload files to your server, you can use an SFTP client like Filezilla which simply can be used
            by entering your server IP, username, and password. Follow the steps below:</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Step 1 - Download and install Filezilla</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS, and SFTP client with lots of useful
            features and an intuitive graphical user interface. Download this free software from here</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Install Filezilla on your computer and open it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Step 2 - Login to your server using FileZilla</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Enter your server IP, username, and password inside the boxes at the top in FileZilla. Make sure your enter
            22 as the port. Press enter and wait for some time.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Step 3 - Uploading files to your server</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>You can now upload files to your server by navigating to the directory of your choice and dragging/dropping
            your files into the folder(on your server) of your choice.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Enabling passwordless login to your server</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Every time we need to log in to our server, we type 'ssh user@ip-address' command followed by the strong
            password which is quite cumbersome.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We can avoid typing this strong password without having to compromise security by authorizing our machine to
            log in to the server without the password every time we type a single (short) command. Follow the steps
            below:</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Step 1 - Create a private-public key pair</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>We can create a private-public key pair using ssh-keygen. Execute the following command on your server:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>
        <hr>
        <p>This generates a private-public key pair on your computer. Press enter 3 times to choose the default options.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Step 2 - Deploy ssh key on your server</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Login to your server using ssh(preferably non-root user) and password and execute the following command:</p>
        <hr>
        <code>
                cd ~
                <br>
            mkdir .ssh

            </code>
            <hr>
            <p>This will create a .ssh in the home directory ('/home/shikhar/' in my case) of your user. DigitalOcean droplet ships with a root account so creating this '.ssh' directory is not needed if you want to configure serverless login for root.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Execute the following command on your host computer:</p>
            <hr>
            <code>scp C:\Users\shikhar\.ssh\id_rsa.pub shikhar@165.232.177.116:~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
            <hr>
            <p>Replace 'C:\Users\shikhar' with your user home directory on Windows. You will be prompted for the password. Enter your password and your ssh key will be deployed.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Step 3 - Test your passwordless login</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Try to log into your server by entering the following command. Replace user with your username and ip-address with your server's ip address</p>
            <hr>
            <code>ssh user@ip-address</code>
            <hr>
            <h2>Quick login using Powershell profiles</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>If you are using Windows Powershell, you can use PowerShell profiles to efficiently log in to multiple servers. Personally, I manage multiple servers including the one which hosts this site. I need to switch from a personal server to my client's server on a very regular basis. It gets hectic to remember multiple passwords and type them repeatedly. Hence I use PowerShell functions to manage multiple servers. If you are overwhelmed, don't! This is easier than you think and once you configure it you will never look back. Follow the below steps:</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Step 1 - Create a PowerShell profile</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>  Create a PowerShell profile using the command below:</p>
            <hr>
            <code> New-Item $profile -Type File -Force</code>
            <hr>
            <p>This creates a PowerShell profile that will execute whenever you start PowerShell on your computer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Step 2 - Open and add a function to the PowerShell profile</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Open your PowerShell profile by executing the following command on Windows:</p>
            <hr>
            <code>notepad $profile</code>
            <hr>
            <p>As a part of the next step, we will add few functions to our PowerShell profile. Paste the following code to your profile</p>
            <hr>
            <code>
                echo "Hello shikhar, Welcome to PowerShell. Your profile works!" 
                <br>

                <br>
function personal{
    <br>
    Start-Process ssh shikhar@189.59.45.126
    <br>
}
<br>

<br>
function client1{
    <br>
    Start-Process ssh shikhar@139.39.45.126
    <br>
}
<br>

<br>
function client2{
    <br>
    Start-Process ssh root@239.59.45.126
    <br>
}
<br>
            </code>
            <hr>
            <p>Replace the usernames and IP addresses with the actual values of your servers. Finally, save and close the file.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Step 3 - Test your profile</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>If you don't restart PowerShell you will see an error like this:</p>
            <hr>
            <code>
                PS C:\Users\shikhar> notepad $profile
                <br>
PS C:\Users\shikhar> client2
<br>
client2 : The term 'client2' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
<br>
function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or
<br>
if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
<br>
At line:1 char:1
<br>
+ client2
<br>
+ ~~~~~~~
<br>
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (client2:String) [], CommandNotFou
    <br>
   ndException
   <br>
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
    <br>
            </code>
            <hr>
            <p>Restart your PowerShell and type client 2:</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Your profile should now work. Close all the PowerShell instances and reopen PowerShell. Now try to execute any one of the following commands:</p>
            <hr>
            <code>personal</code>
            <hr>
            <code>client1</code>
            <hr>
            <code>client2</code>
<hr>
<p>Wow we are now able to open the server we created for our client by issuing a single word command ie 'client1'</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: You can always configure serverless login for a root user but using a root account for day-to-day activities is not recommended</p>
<hr>
<p>You can configure as many servers as you want of your choice. Hope you understood and will start incorporating this into your server workflows. Happy coding!</p>
